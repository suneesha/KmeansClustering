k-means algorithm using Euclidean distance

Programming language used: Python

Steps to run the code:
1.On the command line go the directory which has all the files 
2.Type or copy and paste the below command to run the python program on command line
       python  kmeans.py 10 test_data.txt output.txt
       
Note:You can change the value of K in the above from 25 to any other number.
Also you can change the name of the output file if the output file with the name already exists.

Initialization:Based on the input parameter(k), randomly select k points as centroids.
Termination Condition:The usual termination condition in k-means is when the centroids no longer move.Here, I also limited my update step to a maximum of 25 iterations.
Output:
<cluster-id> <List of points ids separated by comma>For example,1 2, 4, 7, 10
Validation:The usual method of evaluating the goodness of clustering is used. It is the Sum of Squared Error function, defined as:KSSE = ∑∑dist2(mi,x)i=1 x∈Ci      
where mi is the centroid of the ith cluster.
SSE value for different K values

k=10 SSE=0.757581
k=14 SSE=0.487555
k=8  SSE= 0.903088
k=15 SSE=0.437382
k=5 SSE=1.550493
